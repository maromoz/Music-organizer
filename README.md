Hello Dear User!

This is my music organizer program that takes your music directory and returns a lot of useful information
about your music directory!

The steps of using the program:
1. open the music_files_insert.py through the command line like this "python music_files_insert.py"
2. open the program itself by typing in the command line "python music_organizer.py -h", the following command will show you the program options.


Enjoy!
